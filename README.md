Redux presentation
====

Why? What?
-

This is repository prepared for practical presentation that i made for my work colleagues.
I had not much experience with Redux neither but it still sufficiently decent.

Notice: This is not code that can be used as an boilerplate for any project. Today I would do many thing completely in different way.

Installation
-


clone repo and then:


```bash

cd react
yarn                # or npm install
yarn dev            # or npm start dev


```

then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
