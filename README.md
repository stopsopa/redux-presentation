Redux presentation
====

Why? What?
-

This is repository prepared for practical presentation that i made for my work colleagues at work in order to present advantages of using Redux.
I had not much experience with Redux neither but it still quite decent.

Each commit is another step in explaining of structure.

Notice: This is not code that can be used as an boilerplate for any project. Today I would do many thing completely in different way.
