# DEPRECATED
Created in 2017 - quite old now and not maintained.

What? Nothing to be ashamed here. Redux back then was HOT - we all do mistakes... leave me alone.

Redux presentation
====

Why? What?
-

This is repository prepared for practical presentation that I made for my work colleagues at work in order to present advantages of using Redux.
I had not much experience with Redux neither but it still quite decent.

Each commit is another step in explaining of structure.

Notice: This is not code that can be used as an boilerplate for any project. Probably at the moment of readding it I would do many thing completely in different way then it is presented here.

Installation
-


clone repo and then:


```bash

cd react
yarn                # or npm install
yarn dev            # or npm start dev


```

then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
